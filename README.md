# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Here you will find a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The projects required the use of  [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. 


WHEN The website is opened. 
THEN the current working day is displayed at the top of the calendar from 9am -5pm
WHEN You scroll down
THEN You will see timeblocks for standard working hours
WHEN You  view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN You click into a timeblock
THEN You can enter an event
WHEN you  click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
